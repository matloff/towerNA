A **nonimputational**  method for handling missing values (MVs) 
specifically for **prediction applications.**

# Overview: the Goal Is Prediction, Not Statistical Inference

There are a number of powerful R packages for handling missing values
(MVs), such as *Amelia* and *mice*.  They "fill in the blanks" in 
MV-ridden datasets, so as to enable the user to do statistical inference
on the completed data.

These methods are typical not capable of predicting new cases that have
MVs.  With the *toweranNA* package, **the intended class of applications
is predictive modeling, rather than estimation.**  

Predictive methods of any type can be used with our Tower
Method, including both linear/generalized linear models and
nonparametric/machine learning methods. 

# Usage

The function **makeTower** takes the data and regression model as input,
and creates an object of class 'tower'.  New cases can then be predicted
by calling **predict()** on that object.

The call forms are: 

``` r
makeTower(data, yName, regFtnName, opts = NULL, scaling = NULL, 
    yesYVal = NULL) 
predict(towerObj, newx, k = 1) 
```

The main arguments are: 

* **data**: The training set, a data frame or equivalent.

* **yName**: Name of the column containing "Y", the variable to be
  predicted.

* **regFtnName**: Name of the regression model, currently 'lm', 'glm' or
  'towerKNN'.

* **towerObj**: Object of class "tower" returned by **makeTower()**.

* **newx**: The X data to be predicted (one or more new cases).

* **k**, The number of nearest neighbors. 

The argument **k** is a tuning parameter chosen by the analyst.  

## Example:  Vocabulary acquisition

This data is from the [Stanford University Wordbank
project](http://wordbank.stanford.edu).  The data, **english**, is
included in the <strong>toweranNA</strong> package.  Of the
non-administrative variables, e.g. excluding 'Language', which is always
English in this data, about 43 percent of the values are missing.  

To illustrate how fitting and prediction occur, let's apply Tower to fit
the data and predict Y for the cases having missing values.  We will
take age and gender as predictors.

``` r
data(english)

names(english)
#  [1] "data_id"     "age"         "language"    "form"        "birth_order"
#  [6] "ethnicity"   "sex"         "mom_ed"      "measure"     "vocab"      
# [11] "demo"        "n"           "demo_label" 

# omit administrative variables
engl1 <- english[,c(2,5:8,10)]

head(engl1)
#  age birth_order ethnicity    sex         mom_ed vocab
# 1  24       First     Asian Female       Graduate   337
# 2  19      Second     Black Female        College   384
# 3  24       First     Other   Male Some Secondary    76
# 4  18       First     White   Male      Secondary    19
# 5  24       First     White Female      Secondary   480
# 6  19       First     Other Female   Some College   313

# many MVs
sum(is.na(engl1))
# [1] 9649
# most MVs are near the end
tail(engl1)
#      age birth_order ethnicity    sex mom_ed vocab
# 5493  28        <NA>      <NA>   Male   <NA>   352
# 5494  28        <NA>      <NA> Female   <NA>   460
# 5495  28        <NA>      <NA>   Male   <NA>   292
# 5496  28        <NA>      <NA> Female   <NA>   661
# 5497  28        <NA>      <NA> Female   <NA>   550
# 5498  28        <NA>      <NA>   Male   <NA>   549

#fit linear model for predictingt vocabulary size
towerOut <- makeTower(engl1,'vocab','lm')
```

Say we wish to predict a new case like the child in row 5, but who is
second in birth order, and for whom gender and mother's education are
missing.

``` r
newx <- engl1[5,-6]
newx$birth_order <- 'Second'
newx$sex <- NA
newx$mom_ed <- NA
predict(towerOut,newx)
# [1] 261.9361
```

# toweranNA: A Method Based on Regression Averaging

*Setting:*  We have a dataset in which one of the columns, Y, is to be
predicted in the future.  The remaining columns, collectively referred
to as X, are the predictor variables/features.  Y can be either numeric
or an R factor.

Most of the MV literature concerns estimation of some relationship,  say
comparison of means, analysis of linear regression coefficients and the
like.  One applies some MV method to the original data, obtaining a
"filled-in" version of the data. (or several such versions).  One then
does one's statistical analysis on the new version.

By constrast, our emphasis here is on **PREDICTION**, especially
relevant in our AI era.  The main contribution of this package is a
technique that we call the Tower Method, which is **directly aimed at
prediction**. It is nonimputational, i.e. we do not make guesses as to
the missing values in X.

Note carefully:

* In describing our methods as being for regression applications, *we do
  NOT mean imputing missing values through some regression technique*;
again, our technique is non-imputational.  Instead, our context is that
of regression applications themselves, with the goal being direct
prediction of Y.  

* The term *regression function* does not necessarily imply a linear
  model.  It could also be, say, a logistic model, random forests, etc.

## Vocabulary data example

Consider the above illustration, in which we wished to predict a new
case in which gender and mother's educational level were missed.  Then
our prediction might be the estimated value of the regression function
of wage on age, birth order and ethnicity, i.e. the *marginal
regression function* of wage on that set of variables.

Since each new case to be predicted will likely have a different pattern
of which variables are missing, we would need to estimate many
(potentially 2<sup>5</sup> = 32) marginal regression functions.  For
datasets with p predictors, 2<sup>p</sup> of these would be needed.
This would in many applications be computationally infeasible, as each
marginal model would need to be fitted and run through diagnostic plots,
hyperparameter investigation, and the like.

**But the Tower Property provides an alternative.**  It tells us that **we can
obtain the marginal regression functions from the full one.**  

## The Tower Property

There is a theorem in abstract probability theory that says for 
random variables Y, U and V, 

``` 
   E[ E(Y|U,V) | U ] = E(Y | U) 
``` 

Though abstract, it is intuitive.  Say Y, U and V are Wage,
Gender and Occupation.  E(Y|U,V) is the mean wage among all workers 
of a given gender, in a given occupation.  If we average that quantity
over men and women, but still keep occupation fixed, we obtain the mean
wage in that occupation.
 
In terms of regression functions, this says that if we take the regression
function of Y on U and V, and average it over V for fixed U, we get the
regression function of Y on U.  If V is missing but U is known, this is
very useful, as we will now explain.  

## How it solves our problem

In our vocabulary example above, for a new case in which age, birth
order and  ethnicity for whom gender and mother's education are missing.
we would have

```
U  = (age, birth order, ethnicity)
V = (gender,mom_ed)
```

E(Y|U) is the target marginal regression function that we wish to
estimate and then use to predict the new case in hand.  The Tower
Property implies that we can obtain that estimate by the averaging
process described above.

Specifically, we fit the full model to the complete cases in the data,
then average that model over all data points whose values for which the
values of age, birth order and ethnicity match those in the new case to
be predicted.  **Thus only the full model need be estimated, rather than
2<sup>p</sup> models.**

Our package **toweranNA** ("tower analysis with NAs") takes this
approach.  Usually, there may not be many data points having the exact
value specified for U, if any, so we average over a neighborhood of
points near that value.  The argument **k** specifies the number o near
neighbors.  Since we are averaging fitted regression estimates, which
are by definition already smoothed, a small value of **k** should work
well.  

Moreover, an early *Biometrika* paper by one of us (summarized in
(Matloff, 2017, Sec. 7.5)) proved that regression averaging improves
estimation of means, even with no MVs, thus an added bonus. 

# Application to Time Series

One can handle missing values in a time series, by
converting to a data frame, then applyng Tower.

## Example:  Gold time series 

Rob Hyndman's **forecast** package includes a time series **gold**,
consisting of 1108 daily gold prices.   The series does have some NAs,
including two in the final 10 data points:

``` r
data(gold,package='forecast')
gold[1099:1108]
# [1] 395.30 394.10 393.40 396.00     NA     NA 391.25 383.30 384.00 382.30
```
Let's predict the 1109th data point, using the Tower Method:

``` r
gx <- regtools::TStoX(gold,10)
dim(gx)
# 1098   11
# row i contains gx[i], gx[i+1,...,gx[i+10]
gxd <- as.data.frame(gx)
twout <- makeTower(gxd,'V11','lm') 
x1109 <- gold[1099:1108]  # X for predicting gold[1109] 
x1109 <- matrix(x1109,nrow=1)
colnames(x1109) <- colnames(gxd[,-11])
predict(twout,x1109) 
# 393.8496
```

The function **TStoX()**, which the package imports from **regtools**,
transforms the data to an 11-column matrix, designed for analysis of lag 10.  
In each row of **gx**, we see a value in column 11, preceded in the
row by the 10 most recent points.  That 11th column is the original time
series, minus the first 10 observations.  So, the call to **lm()** is
loosely autoregressive, with each time point predicted from the previous
10.

# Assumptions

Compared to the widely-used  packages **Amelia** and **mice**,
**toweranNA** has far less restrictive assumptions.  E.g. **Amelia**
assumes multivariate normality of the X vector, an assumption not even
approximately met when some components of X are categorical variables.
Both of those packages make the standard Missing at Random (MAR)
assumption.

In our Tower Method, the assumption involves Y:

E(Y | U, V<sub>NA</sub>) = E(Y | U)

where V<sub>NA</sub> is a boolean variable symbolizing that the variables in 
V are missing.

This assumption is neither implies nor is implied by MAR, but it is
similar to that condition.  As with MAR, this assumption is not
verifiable, and thus we must simply ask, ``Does it work?'', meaning
looking at how well it predicts new cases.
